<pre>This project aims to compare supermarket prices to gain insights on what aspects a supermarket is potentially superior when compared to another.

Comparison methods:

- Average prices per product type

- Prices of the exact same products

- Own brand products

- Best price for value sections (such as the "Prijsfavoriet" at the Albert Hijen)
